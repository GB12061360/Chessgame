# Chessgame

This repository now contains two ways to experience Crimson Knights Chess:

- **Web version** (original): open `index.html` in a browser to play with the interactive
  JavaScript-powered board.
- **Java edition** (new): a pure Java port of the same engine that can be run from the
  command line.

## Running the Java edition

1. Navigate to the `java` directory: `cd java`.
2. Compile and run with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.crimsonknights.chess.ChessCli"
   ```
   (You can also compile with `mvn package` and run the generated jar.)
3. Enter moves in coordinate notation (e.g., `e2e4`, `g7g8q`). Type `undo` to revert the
   last move, `reset` to restart, or `exit` to quit.

The Java engine mirrors the rules implemented in the browser edition, supporting special
moves such as en passant, castling, and promotions.
